# Kiribot (Discord Bot)

KiriBot is a bot created by myself for my discord server. But this can be used in any discord server (if you host it yourself). It's packed with certain features that some server owners might find valuable. Since I cannot directly host this bot for you, you will need your own discord token. Some of the API features that the bot offers might require you to get your own API token/key for it if you want the feature. Otherwise, you can disable the feature manually in the configuration.ini file. My rational for making this bot is that it is more customized and the bot is geared towards for my own server, but there is a possiblity that others might find this bot useful as well. I am taking ideas and consideration and adding certain features to this discord bot.

Here are the list of files that you might want to look into
- configuration.ini (This is where you put in the API keys that are needed in order for certain functionalities of the bot to work.)
- main.py (This is where you can run the actual bot but make sure you put in the required information in the configuration.ini)

List of Currently Supported APIs:
- OSU (this is for the game OSU that uses the api to get player data)
- Discord.py (This is the main API to support discord module)

<u> List of features: </u>
- Can play music (Skip/Play/Add to Queue/Show Queue Music)
- Get Server Members

Future Goals/Plans:
- Add an Economy System - Minigame like system for the bot
- User customization (Kind of like a personalized card for the user)
- Add a level system for the user

Made with:
- Python
- MongoDB (Storing Bot Data)

#Important Reminder: I am not liable for anything that happens when you use this bot. Use at your own risk. Please do not copy this as this is my own work, but you are free to use it.
